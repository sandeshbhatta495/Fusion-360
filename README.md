# 3D Modeling and G-Code Conversion

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository showcases my journey in **3D modeling and design**, including some of my initial projects. It contains sample files that highlight my ability to create **functional and aesthetic 3D models** using software like **Fusion 360**. Additionally, it includes **G-code files** to help in 3D printing.

## 📂 Repository Contents
### 🔹 3D Design Files
- **Mobile Stand** (`.f3d`, `.step`, `.stl`) – A minimalistic stand for smartphones.
- **Greeting Card** (`.f3d`, `.stl`) – A custom-designed 3D greeting card.
- **Other Future Designs** – More models will be added as I progress.

### 🔹 G-Code Files for 3D Printing
- Converted `.gcode` files from the models to be directly used with **3D printers**.
- These files help translate the design into physical form.

### 🔹 Previews & Screenshots
- Rendered images of the models for easy visualization.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
This repository represents:
1. **My skills in 3D modeling** – Designing creative and functional models.
2. **My experience with 3D printing** – Preparing G-code for accurate printing.
3. **Sharing my work** – Open for collaboration and improvement.

## 🛠️ Tools & Software Used
- **Fusion 360** – For designing and modeling.
- **Cura / PrusaSlicer** – For converting STL files to G-code.
- **3D Printers** – Testing and optimizing the designs.

## 🔗 How to Use
1. Download the `.stl` or `.step` files.
2. Open them in your **3D slicing software** (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
3. Convert them into **G-code** as per your printer specifications.
4. Print and enjoy! 🎉

## 📌 Future Goals
✅ Create more **complex and optimized** 3D models.  
✅ Experiment with **different materials** and **printing techniques**.  
✅ Develop **customized solutions** for practical applications.
